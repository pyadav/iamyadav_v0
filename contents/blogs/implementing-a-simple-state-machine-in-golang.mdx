State machines are a powerful concept in computer science, allowing you to model complex systems as a series of simple states and transitions 
between them. By breaking down the behaviour of a system into smaller, more manageable states, you can write more organized, error-resistant code. 
In this post, we'll show you how to build a simple state machine in Go, providing a clear and structured way of describing and organizing the 
behaviour of your system.

**While this implementation is not recommended for use in production environments**, you'll get a better understanding of 
how state machines work and how they can be implemented in your own code.

If you are interested in accessing the code for this project, you can refer to my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/pyadav/implementing-a-simple-state-machine-in-golang).


## A state machine
> A state machine is a mathematical model that describes the behaviour of a system based on a set of states and the transitions between those states. 
In other words, it's a way to represent complex systems as a series of simple states and transitions between them.

## How state machines work
A state machine consists of a set of states, a set of transitions, and a set of events or conditions that trigger those transitions. 
Each state represents a particular condition or mode of operation for the system, and transitions represent the changes that occur when the system moves from one state to another.
**For example**, 
![](/assets/traffic_light.svg)
let's consider a simple traffic light system. 

1. A traffic light system has three states: red, yellow, and green, which correspond to the different colors of the traffic light.
2. Transitions between these states are triggered by events, such as a timer or a sensor that detects the presence of a car at an intersection.
3. When the traffic light is in the red state, it means that traffic must stop.
4. When the event is triggered, the traffic light transitions to the yellow state, indicating that the light is about to turn red.
5. Finally, the light transitions to the green state, indicating that traffic can proceed.
6. Each transition can have associated actions or behaviors that occur when the transition is triggered, such as a buzzer or flashing light to warn drivers that the light is about to change.


In summary, state machines are a way to model the behaviour of a system or process by representing the system as a set of states and transitions 
between those states, triggered by events or conditions. State machines are useful for modeling systems that exhibit discrete behaviour and 
can help developers to better understand the behaviour of their software.

## Implementing a state machine in Go

### Creating a State interface
To implement a state machine in Go, we'll start by creating a State interface that defines the methods that each state must implement. 
Here the State interface having three methods, Enter, Exit, Update. Enter() is called when a state is entered, Exit() is called when a state is exited, 
and Update() is called to update the state machine.

```go
type State interface {
	Enter()
	Exit()
	Update(l *StateMachine)
}
```

### Creating a StateMachine struct
Next, we'll create a StateMachine struct that will represent the state machine to mantain states and transitions between them. 
The StateMachine struct will have two fields, currentState and states. The currentState field will hold the current state of the state machine, and 
the states field will hold all the possible states of the state machine.

```go
type StateMachine struct {
    currentState State
    states       map[string]State
}

func (sm *StateMachine) setState(s State) {
	sm.currentState = s
  sm.currentState.Enter()
}

func (sm *StateMachine) Transition() {
	sm.currentState.Update(sm)
}
```

### Implementing the State interface
Each state in the state machine should implement the State interface, defining the behaviour for each event or condition that can trigger a transition.
```go
type RedLight struct{}

func (g RedLight) Enter() {
	fmt.Println("Red light is on. Stop driving.")
	time.Sleep(time.Second * 5)
}
func (g RedLight) Exit() {}
func (g RedLight) Update(l *StateMachine) {
	l.setState(&GreenLight{})
}

type GreenLight struct{}

func (g GreenLight) Enter() {
	fmt.Println("Green light is on. You can drive.")
	time.Sleep(time.Second * 5)
}
func (g GreenLight) Exit() {}
func (g GreenLight) Update(l *StateMachine) {
	l.setState(&YellowLight{})
}

type YellowLight struct{}

func (g YellowLight) Enter() {
	fmt.Println("Yellow light is on. Prepare to stop.")
	time.Sleep(time.Second * 5)
}
func (g YellowLight) Exit() {}
func (g YellowLight) Update(l *StateMachine) {
	l.setState(&RedLight{})
}

```

### Implementing the StateMachine struct
The StateMachine struct should define the logic for transitioning between states based on the current state and the event or condition that triggers the transition.
```go
func NewStateMachine(initialState State) *StateMachine {
	sm := &StateMachine{
		currentState: initialState,
		states:       make(map[string]State),
	}

  sm.currentState.Enter()
  return sm
}
```



### Example usage of the state machine in Go
In the main function, we create a StateMachine instance with the RedLight state as the initial state. 
We then call the Transition method in an infinite loop to simulate the traffic light changing states indefinitely.

Note that this is a very simple example, and in a real-world traffic light implementation, 
there would be many more states and transitions to handle.

```go
func main() {
  sm := NewStateMachine(&RedLight{})

	for {
		sm.Transition()
	}
}
```

## Benefits of using state machines
State machines promote modularity, making it easier to test, reuse, and swap out different parts of your system without affecting the entire system. 
By reducing the complexity of your system, state machines can also help reduce errors and make it easier to identify and correct problems.

### Improved clarity and structure
State machines provide a clear and structured way of describing and organizing the behaviour of complex systems. 
They allow developers to break down the behaviour into smaller, more manageable states and transitions, making it easier to understand, 
maintain, and modify the system.

### Modularity
State machines promote modularity by separating the states and transitions from the rest of the system. 
This makes it easier to test, reuse, and swap out different parts of the system without affecting the entire system.

## Conclusion

State machines are a useful tool for modeling the behaviour of a system or process, and can help you write more organized, error-resistant code. 
By breaking down the behaviour of your system into smaller, more manageable states and transitions, 
you can better understand the behaviour of your software and make it easier to test, debug, and modify.
