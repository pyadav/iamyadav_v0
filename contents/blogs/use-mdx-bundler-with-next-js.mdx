For my personal blog, I have to choose a MDX file in order to display rich content or embed custom react components in markdown. Before going further how to use **MDX with Next.JS**, I would like to explain why I select MDX and [mdx-bundler](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler) to compile my markdown files.

The source code for this tutorial can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/pyadav/use-mdx-bundler-with-next-js).

## Definition of markdown

As per **John Gruber**, the original creator of [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/):

> Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML)

Here's what Markdown looks like:

```md
Hello there! My name is **praveen yadav**.
Here's my favorite programming language list:

- Rust
- Golang
- Node.js
```

## Why we need MDX

MDX is just an extension of Markdown that allows you to import and write JSX in your markdown documents.

Markdown can be used for creating web pages, documents or any text that needs to be transformed into other formats like For web applications, Markdown needs to be transformed into HTML. But, Using Markdown you can only use a handful of HTML elements.

MDX takes the format a step further, and allows us to include our own custom elements, in the form of React components:

```js
import ProductList from '../components/ProductList';
Here's an list of **Awesome projects**

<ProductList
  title="Awesome projects"
  data={[
    { label: 'Rust', link: 'https://www.rust-lang.org/' },
    { label: 'React', value: 'https://reactjs.org/' },
    { label: 'Go', link: 'https://golang.org/' },
  ]}
/>
```

In order to display content in the browser, you need to parse the markdown file and compile it to HTML. On this blog, I am using

1. [gray-matter](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter) to parse my markdown files and
2. [mdx-bundler](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler) to compile MDX/TSX strings and give you back a component which you can render in the browser.

**mdx-bundler** uses [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/), so it's VERY fast and supports TypeScript files (for the dependencies of your MDX files). It also uses [@mdx-js/esbuild
](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx), an esbuild plugin to support JSX in your markdown content.

## Benefits of mdx-bundler

These are popular MDX compiler that are available on the market right now -

1. Official MDX support by Next.js [Next.js + MDX](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@next/mdx)
2. Hashicorp's [next-mdx-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote)
3. Kent C Dodds's [mdx-bundler](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler)

> If you have a lot of files that all import and use different components, you may benefit from using mdx-bundler, as [next-mdx-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote) currently only allows components to be imported and made available across all pages.

I decided to use [mdx-bundler](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler) because it has a very **good performance** and **great features** like

1. **Components import within a mdx file**
2. Frontmatter supports
3. Ability to use frontmatter in mdx file
4. Bundle image within a mdx file using [remark-mdx-images](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-mdx-images)

Now you know why you pick mdx-bundler for your MDX contents, let's see how to use it with Next.JS.

### bundleMDX

Next.js support two form of [pre-rendering](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#pre-rendering): [Static Generation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#static-generation-with-data) and [Server-side Rendering](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#server-side-rendering). Here, we are using Static Generation to generate HTML files at build time. We will be calling **_bundleMDX_** which takes MDX source as string to compile MDX files to HTML.

```js
const getCompiledMDX = async (source: string) => {
  // Add your remark and rehype plugins here
  const remarkPlugins = [];
  const rehypePlugins = [];

  try {
    return await bundleMDX({
      source: source
      mdxOptions(options) {
        options.remarkPlugins = [
          ...(options.remarkPlugins ?? []),
          ...remarkPlugins,
        ];
        options.rehypePlugins = [
          ...(options.rehypePlugins ?? []),
          ...rehypePlugins,
        ];

        return options;
      },
    });
  } catch (error) {
    throw new Error(error);
  }
};
```

#### Next.JS esbuild ENOENT Issue

Sometime we get esbuild issue when it's not able to find executable path. _esbuild_ relies on \_\_dirname to find its executable file. In order to provide the correct path of esbuild executable, we need to provide point esbuild binary path directly in **_bundleMDX_** function.

```js
import path from "path";

if (process.platform === "win32") {
  process.env.ESBUILD_BINARY_PATH = path.join(
    process.cwd(),
    "node_modules",
    "esbuild",
    "esbuild.exe",
  );
} else {
  process.env.ESBUILD_BINARY_PATH = path.join(
    process.cwd(),
    "node_modules",
    "esbuild",
    "bin",
    "esbuild",
  );
}
```

### getMDXComponent

MDX Bundler supplies **_getMDXComponent_** function to turn the string of compiled code into something you can mount.

```JS
import React, {useMemo} from 'react'
import {getMDXComponent} from 'mdx-bundler/client'


const Post = ({ code, frontmatter }) => {
  const Component = useMemo(() => getMDXComponent(code), [code]);

  return (
    <div className={styles.container}>
      <Component />
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Conclusion

I hope this article will help you to understand how to use MDX with Next.JS using mdx-bundler. You can see a working demo at [GitHub](https://github.com/pyadav/use-mdx-bundler-with-next-js).
